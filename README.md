This file mainly contains a description of a team assignment done by Akshay, Mahesh and Chaitanya to understand principle on information hiding.

The team members here did develop a prioritizer interface and three implementation classes for the same. There is a class of "T" items and a comparator function that compares two items of the class.

The main operations which had to be performed were :
  1) Insert.
  2) Remove(Change phase).
  3) Remove in order according to specific function.
  4) Remove any item.
  5) Operation to obtain number of items.
  6) To check if prioritizer is in the insertion phase or not.
  
 All of these operations were to be performed and executed by team members using classes named as Prioritizer1, Prioritizer2, Prioritizer3.
 There was a common interface developed which reflected all the operations and each class had all the overriden methods.
 
 Finally, there was a Main class created which was used to bind all the prioritizer classes.
 
  The Prioritizer1 was developed by Akshay and condition while developing it was, if not in insertion phase, the contents are kept sorted    according to the order.
  
  The Prioritzer2 was developed by Mahesh and condition here was, contents are kept sorted according to the order at all times.
  
  The Prioritizer3 was developed by me and it was based on condition that there should be no Representation variant which was used to determine if data items were valid representations of abstract data items.
  
  
 The interface was developed by Akshay and the main class was developed by all three of us.
 Regular meetings and conversations were conducted from Oct 5-7 for the Main class creation and also for prioritizer interface
 Each prioritizer class was checked and compiled and detailed discussion was conducted on the flow of whole assignment and its execution on Oct 15 and 16.
